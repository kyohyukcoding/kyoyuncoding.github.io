TODO:

1. Add error handling to the API code. Make sure that it gives a warning or error code if the URI is incorrect, or if the formatting is wrong.
3. Add all the artist names to the artist column in the track recommendations table.
4. Add a number which changes based on the value of the sliders next to the values.
5. Add the range parameters to the API request.
6. Link with Spotify API to create playlist for user based on the recommended songs.
7. Refactor everything nicely into separate CSS and JS files. Perhaps refactor code into modular functions, focus on DRY principles.
8. Allow to add multiple URLS, optimized for mobile.
9. Maybe remove the number of songs input so that it just creates you a playlist easily rather than having to faff about with how many songs you want on a playlist.

DONE:

2. Make the table reset each time the request is made.
