                ThinkDev is a structured journal, allowing users to systematically approach programming problems to reach and store effective solutions.

            <p>
                I decided to create this project to solve a problem that I had been facing. The problem was that when approaching different programming problems, such as the more defined problems found in LeetCode, or more vague problems of the sort found in the real world, and attempting to use best practices such as writing pseudo-code, and whiteboarding the problem before writing source code, that my documentations of these problems were scattered and not easily referred back to or accessed. It got to the point that the friction I experienced whilst attempting to apply these best practices was so great, I would rather attempt to solve the problem directly, rather than having to sift through different Google Docs files, and scrolling endlessly, to refer back to problems that I had been working on for multiple sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project allows users to structure their thoughts when approaching a problem, prompting users to first write down in natural language their understanding of the problem, then to write out their thoughts in pseudo-code, before translating the pseudo-code into source code. These problems can then be saved, accessed, edited, and deleted. The past versions of each problem can also be viewed. I believe that by consistently approaching problems in this way, whilst being able to easily store and access thoughts, users' general problem-solving skills will be strengthened, and users will be encouraged to think about a problem extensively, before attempting to code a solution.
