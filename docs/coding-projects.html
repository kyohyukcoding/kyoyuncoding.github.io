            <p>
                I created this project to solve a recurring issue I faced: my documentation for programming problems was scattered and hard to access. This made it frustrating to follow best practices like pseudo-coding and whiteboarding, to the point where I often skipped them entirely to avoid digging through disorganized notes and endless Google Docs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project guides users through a structured problem-solving process: first writing a natural language explanation, then pseudocode, and finally source code. Each problem can be saved, edited, deleted, and versioned for easy reference. By promoting consistent, thoughtful workflows and easy access to past work, the tool encourages deeper problem analysis and promotes effective problem-solving.
